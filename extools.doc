.te 2 EXCLSFIL Close a file handle

        This functions closes a previously opened file handle.

        werror = exclsfil(whandle);

        int werror              -1 if an error occurred,
                                 0 if everything went according to plan.

        int whandle             The opened file handle.


.te 2 EXFNDFST Find first matching file

        This function finds the first matching file given a file
        specification i.e. *.c

        werror = exfndfst(wmask,wattr,&wdta);

        int werror      returns 0 if a match was found, otherwise there
                        are no files matching the mask specification.

        char *wmask     File specification i.e. "*.TXT"

        int wattr       Attribute to search for.
                        1 : Read Only
                        2 : Hidden
                        4 : System
                        8 : Volume Label
                       16 : Sub-Directory
                       32 : Archive
                       These may be "OR"ed together to get combinations.
                       Use 0 for normal files, 0xFF for ALL files

        TDIR wdta;     Structure defined in EXTOOLS.H which defines the
                       disk transfer address buffer, with various directory
                       fields.

.te 2 EXFNDNXT Find next matching file

        Find the next matching file after initially calling exfndfst.

        werror = exfndnxt(&wdta);

                        are no more files matching the mask specification.

        TDIR wdta       Structure defined in EXTOOLS.H which defines the
                        disk transfer address buffer, with various directory
                        fields.


        EX.
          #include <extools.h>

          int werror;           /* return error code */
          TDIR wdta;            /* disk directory buffer */

          werror = exfndfst("*.*",0,&wdta);   /* list all files in directory */

          while (werror == 0) {
            printf("\n%s",wdir.name);
            werror = exfndnxt(&wdta);
          }


.te 2 EXGETDR Return the current working directory.

        Return the working sub-directory as a string.The string will
        not have a "\" char after it so if you want to use this for
        searches, you must concatenate a "\" to it, especially if you
        are in the root dir as it may return "".

        exgetdr(wdir);

        char *wdir      Current working sub-directory string on return

                        2 : Drive C
                        etc..


.te 2 EXGETVOL Get the volume label of a drive

        Get the volume label for the specified drive;

        wptr = exgetvol(wdrive,wvolume);

                        etc.

        char
        *wvolume        String for volume label. Make sure to allocate
                        at least 13 chars for this string.

                        et. al.

.te 2 EXREDFIL Read from a file handle.

        Read data from a file handle into a buffer. This is a fairly
        high speed disk access method, very useful for copying files and
        such.

        wnum = exredfil(whandle,wbuf,wamt);

        unsigned
        int wnum        Actual number of bytes read from the file. A value
                        of < wamt (or 0) means end of file.

        1 : Seek relative to Current file position
        2 : Seek relative to End of File

        Note that negative offsets are not allowed !.

        wpos = exsekfil(whandle,woffset,wmethod);

        long wpos       Position of the file pointer in bytes relative
                        to the beginning of the file.

        unsigned int
        woffset         Offset of bytes to seek from one of the
                        methods specified in wmethod.

        int wmethod     0 : Seek relative to beginning of file.
                        1 : Seek relative to Current file position
                        2 : Seek relative to End of File


        EX.

          /* how to seek to the end of the file minus one */

          int whandle;
          long fsize,exsekfil();

          . . . . .

          /* assume file was already opened at this point */

          fsize = exsekfil(whandle,0L,2);           /* seek to end of file */
          if (fsize) {
            fsize --;                               /* subtract 1 from size */
            exsekfil(whandle,fsize,0);              /* seek to eof - 1 */
          }


.te 2 EXWRTFIL Write data to a file handle.

        Write data from a buffer to a file handle. Like exredfil, this
        routine is useful for high speed data transfer.

        unsigned
        int wnum        Actual number of bytes written to the file.

        int whandle     The handle of the previously opened file from a call
                        to exopnfil/excrtfil

        char *wbuf      Buffer to write the data from. Usually an array or
                        pointer to char.

        unsigned
        int wamt        The number of bytes requested to write.

.te 1 .ce STRING HANDLING

.te 2  INDEX Return the index of a character in a string.

        Return the index position of the occurance of a character
        in a substring or -1 if the character was not found.

        wpos = index(wsource,wch);

        int wpos        index of occurance of character wch in the string
                        wsource. Returns -1 if no occurance.

        char *wsource   Pointer to the source string to search.

        int wch         Character to do the search for.

.te 2 EXCHRSTR Concatenate a character onto a string

        This function performs the task of appending a single char
        to a string (which strcat will not do). It appends a null
        terminating character to the end of the source string to
        maintain string compatibility.

        exchrstr(wsource,wch);

        char *wsource   Source string to concatenate character to

        int wch         Character to concatenate to wsource.

.te 2 EXCNTSTR Return a centered string.

        This function returns a string padded with blanks to be
        centered in a give field width. Note that the maximum limit
        on string size for this routine is 255. The routine itself
        does NO range checking so it is up to the application itself
        to insure that this does not happen. This routine uses a static
        buffer for the pointer to return so subsequent calls to the routine
        destroy the previous contents of the returned pointer!

        wptr = excntstr(wsource,wnum);

        char *wptr      pointer to centered string.

        char *wsource   String to have centered.

        wnum            Width of field to center on.

.te 2 EXDLTSTR Delete a substring from another string.

        Give a starting and ending position, this routine will remove
        a portion of a string.

.te 2 EXGETPCE Get delimited piece of substring

        This routine returns the "n"th piece of a delimited string.
        i.e. Jaz;10318 Broom Lane;Seabrook;Md;20706
        the 3rd ";" piece of the string is "Seabrook"

        wptr = exgetpce(wsource,wdestin,wdel,wnum);

        char *wptr      Pointer to wdestin, the destination piece.

        char *wsource   The source string with delimiters

        char *wdestin   The destination string.

        int wdel        The character used as a delimiter

        int wnum        Which piece do you want?

.te 2 EXINSSTR Insert a string into another string.

        This routine does a string insert of one string into another at
        a given starting position. Note that if wstart is > than the
        length of the source string, blanks will be appended.

        exinsstr(wdestin,wsource,wstart);

        char *wdestin   Pointer to destination string (to be inserted).

        char *wsource   Pointer to string to insert

        int wstart      Index of position to start inserting.

.te 2 EXLFTSTR Return the left n chars from a string

        This routine returns the left n chars of a given string.
        note that this routine uses a static 255 byte buffer for the pointer to
        return so subsequent calls to the routine destroy the
        previous contents of the returned pointer!

        wptr = exlftstr(wstr,wnum);

        char *wptr      Pointer to static buffer containing the left string.

        char *wstr      Source string

        int wnum        The number of chars you want from the source string.

.te 2 EXPAD Pad a string

        This routine pads a given string with a given char.
        Note that this routine uses a static 255 byte buffer for the pointer to
        return so subsequent calls to the routine destroy the
        previous contents of the returned pointer!

        wptr = expad(wstr,wch);

        char *wptr      Pointer to static buffer containing padded string.

        char *wstr      Source string to pad.

        int wch         Character to pad with.


.te 2 EXRGTJST Right justify a string

        This routine right justifies a given string. Effectively padding to
        the right.
        Note that this routine uses a static 255 byte buffer for the pointer to
        return so subsequent calls to the routine destroy the
        previous contents of the returned pointer!

        wptr = exrgtjst(wstr,wnum);

        char *wptr      Pointer to static buffer containing padded string.

        char *wstr      Source string to pad.

        int wch         Character to pad with.

.te 2 EXRGTSTR Return the right n chars of a string

        This routine returns the rightmost n chars of a given string.
        Note that this routine uses a static 255 byte buffer for the pointer to
        return so subsequent calls to the routine destroy the
        previous contents of the returned pointer!

        wptr = exrgtstr(wstr,wnum);

        char *wptr      Pointer to static buffer containing the left string.

        char *wstr      Source string

        int wnum        The number of chars you want from the source string.

        long wtics      Number of tics to delay. There are about 18
                        clock tics in a second. Make sure you use a
                        long value here or the high word may cause
                        you to "hang" for a long time. (No Pun Intended)

	This function Creates a window on the screen, surrounds it with
	a double-lined box and makes it the current window. The area
	under the window is saved and restored on close_window(). The
	coordinates are ABSOLUTE and the origin is 0,0. The dimensions
	include the border if border type window is specified.
		The Dimensions of the Current window are accessible via
	the global pointer variable crnt_window defined in EXTOOLS.H.
		This function also sets the TURBOC window, so the TURBOC
	console read/write (cprintf etc) functions shall also work fine.


	struct crnt_wind_rec {
      	   int cul,rul,clr,rlr,attr;  Dimensions of text area in window
           void *svscr;		      Pointer to saved area of screen

	home the cursor. Only the Current window will be cleared and it
	will be set to the attribute specified when the window was
	created.

        void cls(void);


.te 2 EXCLREOL Clear to the end of the line

        This routine clears the line from the given position to the
        end of the line or the extent of the window. Row and Column
	coordinates are relative to the current window . The line is
	cleared with the attribute specified when the window was created


        void exclreol(wrow,wcol);

        int wrow        Row position to clear from

        int wcol        Column position to clear from


.te 2 EXDRWBOX Draw a box to the display screen.

.te 2 EXINSTR Edit a string with editing keys.

        This routine provides a formatted editing for a field.
        It is similar in style to DBASE or WORDSTAR.
	This function does not conform to Knowledge of Many Things
	standards. It may be used BUT it will not record keyboard
	Macros.

        wkey = instr(wstr,wlen,wrow,wcol,wattr,wtime,wkeystr);

        int wkey        This is the key that was pressed to end the input.
                        It is usually the return key, but if you have
                        activated other keys using wkeystr, it would be
                        the scan code of an active key.

        int wlen        Max length of the field.

        int wrow        Starting row of field edit.

        int wcol        Starting col of field edit.

                        key is returned.

        char *wkeystr   String of scan codes to terminate the read on.
                        i.e. If you want to activate the F1 key which
                        would be "\x3B"

        EX.

        #define cESC "\001"
